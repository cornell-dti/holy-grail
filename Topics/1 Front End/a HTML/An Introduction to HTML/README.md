# HTML: What is it?
HTML, short for **H**pyer**t**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage, dictates the
structure and content of a website. Nothing happens without HTML; it is
the most basic form of web design there is. You do not need CSS or JavaScript
on an HTML page, but you will almost always have some of both as you progress
in your web design adventures. CSS and JavaScript both work with HTML, and
require there be *some* HTML on the page (although in the latter's case,
you can create the HTML you need.)

Another question I'd like to answer is: "What *isn't* HTML?" HTML **is not**
a programming language, or at least not one in the conventional sense
like JavaScript, C++, Python, or Java. The name of this syntax tells us
what it is: a Markup Language. There are no variables, functions, loops,
or any object oriented concepts present in HTML. Getting us out of the mindset
that HTML is a programming language will prepare us for...

# HTML: Syntax
HTML's syntax is fairly easy to understand up front, with a few quirks.
HTML elements are defined with carrots, and the name of the element goes
inside those carrots to tell us *what* HTML element we'd like to implement.
We must also close an HTML element once we've determined what content goes
inside of it. That way, you, the developer, are exactly in control of what
goes inside an HTML element.

```
<div>
    Hello, world!
</div>
```

This will embed a `div` container on our website, which just says
"Hello, world!". We can include any arbitrary content in HTML element, including
other HTML elements.

```
<div>
    Hello, world!
    <p>
        How are you today?
    </p>
</html>
```

We've inserted a `p` element inside our existing `div` element. We can
do this as much as we like, or as much as we think is necessary for our
page.

```
<div>
    Hello, world!
    <p>
        How are you today?
        <span>I'm doing great!</span>
    </p>
</div>
```

You might have noticed a few HTML elements in the above code: `div`, `p`,
and `span`. These are HTML elements that are essential to HTML, and have
their own quirks that separate them from other HTML elements.

# HTML: Basic Elements
| HTML Element | Full Name | Where to use it |
|:------------:|:---------:|:---------------|
| `<div>`      | division  | Generic content on your page; a `div` element will create a new line once the content in the element is completed. |
| `<p>`        | paragraph | Content that resembles paragraphs from a word processor; in addition to creating a new line, there will be a small amount of margin above and below a paragraph element when it's completed. |
| `<span>`     | span      | Inline content that does not add a new line when the content is done; it continues the flow of existing content. |
| `<link>`     | link      | Link (relative or absolute) to some content to bring into our page. Used commonly to import icons and CSS files. |
| `<script>`   | script    | Link (relative or absolute) to some JavaScript file to import and use on a page.|
| `<img>`      | image     | Embeds an image directly in your HTML page. |

Quick note: the `link` and `img` elements are **self closing**. This means that
they do not require a closing `</link>` or `</img>` element when the content
is to be completed, because the only content that this element will ever
show are generated by the element itself. A `link` never shows any content;
rather, it is meant as an import for remote resources or links. An `img`
element will replace the entire content of its element with the appropriate
image; no other content is expected or necessary.

```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./css/index.css">
```

```
<img src="./img/cornell.png">
```

# HTML: Attributes
All HTML elements can contain any number of unique attributes that serve
some function or purpose. You will most commonly see attributes used to
designate a set of CSS classes or IDs, tell a link element where to go,
or tell an input element what kind of user data to accept. Listing all the
inputs would take a very long time, so I've included the highlights below.
And if you want to see the whole list, [look no further](https://www.w3schools.com/elements/ref_attributes.asp)!

| Attribute | Compatible Elements | What it does |
|:------------:|:---------:|:---------------|
| `id`      | All HTML Elements | A list of space-separated CSS IDs to give this HTML element|
| `class`   | All HTML Elements | A list of space-separated CSS classes to give this HTML element|
| `href`    | `a`, `link`       | A remote or local URL to link to (`a`), or retrieve the content from (`link`). |

# HTML: Structure
Browsers are somewhat picky about the general structure of a webpage. Fortunately
for us, almost all browsers are similarly picky about this structure, so
we can consistently implement the same HTML without worrying about browsers
fighting with our code. There are a few HTML elements that dictate a page's
structure, and make things visually and syntactically easy to work with.

| Attribute | What it does |
|:---------:|:-------------|
| `html`    | A container for all HTML content on our page. This tells a browser that this page is an HTML document. |
| `head`    | A container for all CSS, JavaScript, and miscellaneous code declarations. Goes above the `body`. |
| `body`    | A container for our page's content; everything in the `body` is what the user sees. |

If we want to combine the above structure with the code from earlier,
it would look like this:

```
<html>
    <head>
        <!-- CSS, JavaScript, and other things go here -->
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>
            Hello, world!
            <p>
                How are you today?
                <span>I'm doing great!</span>
            </p>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

I added an HTML comment in my `head` element; these are never shown to the user
and aren't HTML elements, but are visible in our code. This can be useful
for developers to add more context or information about our code.

# What's Next?
HTML is only the beginning. Combining it with CSS will make your projects
visually compelling and engaging. Using JavaScript will make those same
sites interactive and functional. Put together, the three of them form the
basis of modern web design.
