# CSS: What is it?
*CSS*, short for **C**ascading **S**tyle**s**heets, is the driving force
behind a website's visuals and design. Without CSS, we would not be gifted
with amazing things like [this cool submarine](https://codepen.io/ajerez/pen/EaEEOW),
[Cornell's own class roster](http://classes.cornell.edu), or [this adorable cat](https://codepen.io/bysusanlin/pen/epxBOV).
